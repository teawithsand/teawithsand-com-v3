# teawithsand-com-v3

3rd version of teawithsand.com, so far the best one.
In the past it used [handmd](https://github.com/teawithsand/handmd).
But now it runs on gatsby.

## Running

1. Clone this repository
2. Install deps via `yarn`
3. Run `yarn run develop`

For now, this site is available at https://teawithsand.com/

Note: this repo does not include:
My deployment scripts
My blogposts, since they are in separate repo
Since recently images, because git handles big files quite badly
